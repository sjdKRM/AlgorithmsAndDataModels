# AlgorithmsAndDataModels
In the course Algorithms and Data Models instructed by Dr. Sean Chester, we had three assignments working with different databases which I upload my reports and queries here. The objective of these assignments are as follows.

## Relational Data
Your goal, in teams of up to four students, will be to perform exploratory data analysis on top of the movie ratings dataset. You have complete freedom to determine what sort of information to extract and visualise in a report based on this data. The only constraints are that you need to design and implement a data schema for the relevant data in the dataset and fulfill the requirements of the rubric attached to this description.
An excellent submission will have some fun with the data and demonstrate fulfillment of the intended learning outcomes given in the description of the Advanced Relational Unit module in Brightspace.

## Graph Structured Data
Back at the turn of the century, humanoids would indulge in a leisurely activity of wandering down to a rental agency to pay for a one week lease on a physical disk on which was inscribed a digital copy of a movie (called a "DVD"). They would then return home and insert the physical disk into a special machine (a "DVD player") that was specially purposed for reading the content of such a disk and converting it into an analogue signal that could be interpreted by a standard television set. About a decade ago, this activity was more or less eradicated with the famous with the bankruptcy of a leading retailer, Blockbuster, though some remnants remain in unsavoury districts of town. Fortunately, that anthropological period overlapped the digital age, and so we have available to us data artefacts recording this activity. It is, however, in relational format. Your task here will be to investigate the data in non-relational layout to extract meaningful insights into the behaviour surrounding this DVD rental activity.
